                        The core components that we use for creating games
                        include, task management, source control, communication,
                        and a game engine. Let's start with the task management.

                        For task management and time logging our team chose to
                        use Jira. The customizability, automation, integration
                        with source control, and other amazing features make
                        Jira the best pick for our team. Speaking of source
                        control integration let's descuss that next.

                        For source control we are using Github. We create a
                        branch for eash Jira issue we are working on. When we
                        commit our changes we can create a Pull Request (PR) to
                        merge into the main branch. All of these steps trigger
                        automatimation in Jira which keeps everything up to
                        date.

                        With many 'Gamers' using Discord as a form of
                        communication it is really natural for our team to use
                        it as well. Everyone on the team has experience with the
                        software and it is a familiar tool. This is the main
                        reason our team chose to use Discord.

                        There are a few choices for what game engine to use
                        while building a game. There is Godo, Unreal Engine, and
                        Unity as the big three. Most people on our team went to
                        the same school and got the same game design degree.
                        With this we were all introduced to Unity and were most
                        familiar with the engine. This is why Unity is our
                        primary game engine.

                        In the future we plan to explore some new tools such as
                        different game engines. Future projects may involve
                        these new tools or we may decide that our current
                        workflow is a good standard for our team.
