##### Congradulations!  
If you are reading this post then you are currently on our new website!  
This website was made using the **Astro**  framework with **Preact** and **MDX** integrations.  
Astro is a static website generator with compatibility to add dynamic islands or hydration islands. We have found that
most of the website doesn't need to be static, but some components are easier to do in dynamic frameworks.
This is where the help of Preact comes in. With Preact being so light weight, about 3kB, makes adding dynamic components a breeze.  
While those are the main components that make up the core of the website, MDX also was a great choice. Being able
to write documents in markdown while also injecting javascript is super helpful. Custom components
can be created in Preact or Astro and they can be directly put into the MDX document. This in turn
is rendered as expected to the page.  
So overall, with the tools at hand, the website is easy to maintian, extensable, and overall a pleasant experience
from a development standpoint. Expect more posts in the blog and more great content from the team.  
~ Thanks for reading!
