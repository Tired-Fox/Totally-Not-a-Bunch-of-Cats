                The core components that we use for creating games include, task
                management, source control, communication, and a game engine.
                Let's start with the task management.

                For task management and time logging our team chose to use Jira.
                The customizability, automation, integration with source
                control, and other amazing features make Jira the best pick for
                our team. Speaking of source control integration let's descuss
                that next.

            <p class="text-indent mb-6">
                For source control we are using Github. We create a branch for
                eash Jira issue we are working on. When we commit our changes we
                can create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the main branch.
                All of these steps trigger automatimation in Jira which keeps
                everything up to date.

                With many 'Gamers' using Discord as a form of communication it
                is really natural for our team to use it as well. Everyone on
                the team has experience with the software and it is a familiar
                tool. This is the main reason our team chose to use Discord.

                There are a few choices for what game engine to use while
                building a game. There is Godo, Unreal Engine, and Unity as the
                big three. Most people on our team went to the same school and
                got the same game design degree. With this we were all
                introduced to Unity and were most familiar with the engine. This
                is why Unity is our primary game engine.

            <p class="text-indent mt-2">
                In the future we plan to explore some new tools such as
                different game engines. Future projects may involve these new
                tools or we may decide that our current workflow is a good
                standard for our team.
