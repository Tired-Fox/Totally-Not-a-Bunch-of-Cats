            The core components that we use for creating games include, task
            management, source control, communication, and a game engine. Let's
            start with the task management.

            For task management and time logging our team chose to use Jira. The
            customizability, automation, integration with source control, and
            other amazing features make Jira the best pick for our team.
            Speaking of source control integration let's descuss that next.

            For source control we are using Github. We create a branch for eash
            Jira issue we are working on. When we commit our changes we can
            create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the main branch. All of
            these steps trigger automatimation in Jira which keeps everything up
            to date.

            With many 'Gamers' using Discord as a form of communication it is
            really natural for our team to use it as well. Everyone on the team
            has experience with the software and it is a familiar tool. This is
            the main reason our team chose to use Discord.

            There are a few choices for what game engine to use while building a
            game. There is Godo, Unreal Engine, and Unity as the big three. Most
            people on our team went to the same school and got the same game
            design degree. With this we were all introduced to Unity and were
            most familiar with the engine. This is why Unity is our primary game
            engine.

            In the future we plan to explore some new tools such as different
            game engines. Future projects may involve these new tools or we may
            decide that our current workflow is a good standard for our team.
